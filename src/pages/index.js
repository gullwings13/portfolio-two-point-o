        <span className="font-bold">Hi!</span> Iâ€™m an empathic and imaginative software engineer with over 20 years working in technology. Having previously designed and implemented reliable, fast and secure Cisco networks, I am now building complex full stack web applications and games in JS/React/Node and C#/Unity. Coding is my passion because I love problem-solving and creating useful things. I aspire to make a positive contribution in an inclusive and collaborative environment.
