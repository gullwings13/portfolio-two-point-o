Hi! Iâ€™m an empathic and imaginative software engineer with over 20 years working in technology. Having previously designed and implemented reliable, fast and secure Cisco networks, I am now building complex full stack web applications and games in JS/React/Node and C#/Unity. Coding is my passion because I love problem-solving and creating useful things. I aspire to make a positive contribution in an inclusive and collaborative environment.

## Why Gatsby?  <img alt="Gatsby" src="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/monogram.svg" width="20" />
  
Having tried Gatsby while building a dynamic, full CRUD wep app (and almost getting there), I wanted to use Gatsby for a static web page and so it was my first choice for constructing my portfolio.

Thanks for visiting my github!
